In this chapter, you’ll apply six metrics to evaluate association rules: __supply, confidence, lift, conviction, leverage, and Zhang's metric__. You’ll then use association rules and metrics to assist a library and an e-book seller.\n",

They approach you to do the analysis and ask that you use the five most highly-rated books from the goodbooks-10k dataset.

To make things simpler, we'll work with shortened book names: _Hunger, Potter, and Twilight_."
