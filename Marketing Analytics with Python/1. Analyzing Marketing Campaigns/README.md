# Course Description
One of the biggest challenges when studying data science technical skills is understanding how those skills and concepts translate into real jobs. 
Whether you're looking to level up in your marketing job by incorporating Python and pandas or you're trying to get a handle on what kinds of work 
a data scientist in a marketing organization might do, this course is a great match for you. We'll practice translating common business questions 
into measurable outcomes, including "How did this campaign perform?", "Which channel is referring the most subscribers?", "Why is a particular 
channel underperforming?" and more using a fake marketing dataset based on the data of an online subscription business. This course will build on 
Python and pandas fundamentals, such as merging/slicing datasets, groupby(), correcting data types and visualizing results using matplotlib.
